# Train and Test Data
Test and train data should be placed inside folder according to the hierarchy given below. 

<br/>

## Test Data
Test data should be placed inside ```test``` folder. This folder will be used to make inference with the trained models. The hierarchy of test data as follows: 

```PhC-C2DH-U373``` <br/>
```|- 01``` <br/>
```|- 02``` <br/>

The result of the inference will be saved in this folder with the relevant type name, such as if only with ```ST``` (Silver Truth) trained model was inferenced the final hierarchy will be as follows: 

```PhC-C2DH-U373``` <br/>
```|- 01``` <br/>
```|- 01_RES-ST``` <br/>
```|- 02``` <br/>
```|- 02_RES-ST``` <br/>

<br/>

## Train Data

Train data should be placed inside ```train``` folder. This folder will be used to train models using different training methods. The hierarchy of train data as follows: 

```PhC-C2DH-U373``` <br/>
```|- 01``` <br/>
```|- 01_GT``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- TRA``` <br/>
```|- 01_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```|- 02``` <br/>
```|- 02_GT``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- TRA``` <br/>
```|- 02_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>

When markers are generated seperately, it will be saved under the folder named ```MARKER``` and the hierarchy will be as follows: 

```PhC-C2DH-U373``` <br/>
```|- 01``` <br/>
```|- 01_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- MARKER``` <br/>
```... ...``` <br/>

## Combining Silver and Gold Truth

Combining silver and gold truth for Cell Segmentation Challenge (CTC) for the primary track. Silver truth data are not accurate, however gold truth data are accurate. To get ST + GT, both ground truth data are combined, where gold truth data will replace silver truth data if there is a conflict between them.

Folder ```01_GT_ST``` is generated by combining datas from ```GT``` and ```ST``` folders.

```PhC-C2DH-U373``` <br/>
```|- 01``` <br/>
```|- 01_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- MARKER``` <br/>
```|- 01_GT_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- MARKER``` <br/>
```... ...``` <br/>

## Training Only Using Gold Truth Data
To train ```GT``` models, predefined ```CSV``` files are used while loading data in dataloader.  All ```CSV``` files are provided inside ```CSV``` folder. Morever, ```GT-All``` file is used to train a single model with Gold Truth for all dataset. 

All 3D datasets are converted to 2D slices to train ```GT``` models.

<br/>

## Training Single Model With Silver Truth and Silver + Gold Truth
To train single model for ```ST``` and for ```GT+ST``` all data needs to be placed inside ```Combined-All``` folder. The hierarchy of this folder is as follows:

```Combined-All``` <br/>
```|- 01``` <br/>
```|- 01_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- MARKER``` <br/>
```|- 01_GT_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- MARKER``` <br/>
```|- 02``` <br/>
```|- 02_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- MARKER``` <br/>
```|- 02_GT_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- MARKER``` <br/>
```|- 03``` <br/>
```|- 03_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- MARKER``` <br/>
```|- 03_GT_ST``` <br/>
```...|- SEG``` <br/>
```...|- MARKER``` <br/>
```... ...``` <br/>

In this case ```01``` and ```02``` folders would be the same content as ```BF-C2DL-HSC``` dataset ```01``` and ```02``` folders, ```03``` and ```04``` folders would be the same content as ```BF-C2DL-MuSC``` dataset ```01``` and ```02``` folders and going like this until ```26```. 

All 3D datasets are converted to 2D slices to train single model for all dataset.
